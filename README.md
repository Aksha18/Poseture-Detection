# Poseture-Detection
Pose Detection Surveillance System 🚀
📌 Project Overview
This AI-powered surveillance system detects predefined friendly poses and identifies potential threats based on body posture. The system operates in real-time using a webcam and alerts security if an individual does not perform a friendly gesture.

🎯 Features
✅ Detects three key poses:

✝️ Jesus Christ Pose
🙌 Hands-Up Pose
🫡 Salute Pose
✅ Real-time detection using OpenCV & MediaPipe
✅ Multi-Angle Recognition (Front, Back, Side, Top-Down)
✅ Non-Blocking Alert System with Threading
✅ Optimized Performance using Frame Skipping & Time Delay

🛠️ Technology Stack
MediaPipe – Human pose estimation
OpenCV – Webcam processing
Pygame – Alert sound playback
Threading – Smooth real-time processing
Time Module – Optimization & performance tuning
📌 System Workflow
1️⃣ Webcam Activation – Captures video frames
2️⃣ Pose Detection – Identifies poses via MediaPipe
3️⃣ Friend or Foe Classification – Compares with predefined poses
4️⃣ Alert System – Plays warning sound if no friendly pose detected
5️⃣ Optimized Processing – Uses frame skipping & time delay for efficiency
